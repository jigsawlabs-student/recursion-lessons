    "In this lesson, we'll practice using recursion to solve the following problems with strings and lists.  Both data structures often lend themselves to recursion because a subset of a list is another list and a subset of a string is another string.  Before, we get goin, remember our approach.\n",

    "When moving through each problem remember to:\n",
    "1. Give yourself an example,\n",
    "2. Solve the example however you can, and then\n",

    "4. Find the base case."
